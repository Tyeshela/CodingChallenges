You are given two sets of numbers and a set of boolean values. Your task is to write a Python function that performs various operations using these operators and returns the results as specified below:

Calculate the result of (x + y) * (x - y) and return it as result1.
Determine if a is greater than or equal to b and return True if it is, otherwise return False as result2.
Calculate the result of x ** y and return it as result3.
Calculate the result of x // y and return it as result4.
Check if the logical OR of p and q is True. If it is, return the string "Logical OR is True" as result5, otherwise return "Logical OR is False".
Calculate the result of x % y and return it as result6.
Calculate the result of a + b * x and return it as result7.
Check if the logical AND of p and q is True. If it is, return the string "Logical AND is True" as result8, otherwise return "Logical AND is False".
Update the value of x by applying the following operations sequentially:
Add 5 to x
Subtract 3 from x
Multiply x by 2
Divide x by 4
Apply integer division of x by 2
Calculate x modulus 2
Raise x to the power of 3
Return the final value of x as result9.
Check if the string "world" is a substring of the text string. If it is, return "Substring found" as result10, otherwise return "Substring not found".
