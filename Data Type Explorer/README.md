Find and return the maximum integer value from the list of integers.
Calculate the sum of all floating-point numbers in the list of floating-point numbers.
Concatenate all the strings in the list of strings into a single string.
Check if both is_true and is_false are True. If they are, return the string "Both are True." Otherwise, return the string "At least one is False."
Return a new list containing only the even numbers from the list of integers.
Create a new list by reversing the order of elements in the names list.
